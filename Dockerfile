# The .ssh directory (/app/.ssh) will be created by the application (src/server.ts)
# if it doesn't exist, using the volume mount from docker-compose.yml.
# The application runs as appuser (UID 3000) due to docker-compose.yml,
# so it will have permission to create /app/.ssh because /app is owned by appuser.

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
